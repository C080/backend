INTRODUCTION_TEXT = f"""
üìê With the plethora of large language models (LLMs) and chatbots being released week upon week, often with grandiose claims of their performance, it can be hard to filter out the genuine progress that is being made by the open-source community and which model is the current state of the art. The ü§ó Open LLM Leaderboard aims to track, rank and evaluate LLMs and chatbots as they are released. 

ü§ó A key advantage of this leaderboard is that anyone from the community can submit a model for automated evaluation on the ü§ó GPU cluster, as long as it is a ü§ó Transformers model with weights on the Hub. We also support evaluation of models with delta-weights for non-commercial licensed models, such as LLaMa.

üìà In the **first tab (LLM Benchmarks)**, we evaluate models on 4 key benchmarks from the <a href="https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness" target="_blank">  Eleuther AI Language Model Evaluation Harness </a>, a unified framework to test generative language models on a large number of different evaluation tasks. In the **second tab (Human & GPT Evaluations)**, the evaluations are performed by having humans and GPT-4 compare completions from a set of popular open-source language models (LLMs) on a secret set of instruction prompts.
"""

LLM_BENCHMARKS_TEXT = f"""
Evaluation is performed against 4 popular benchmarks:
- <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05457" target="_blank">  AI2 Reasoning Challenge </a> (25-shot) - a set of grade-school science questions.
- <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07830" target="_blank">  HellaSwag </a> (10-shot) - a test of commonsense inference, which is easy for humans (~95%) but challenging for SOTA models.
- <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03300" target="_blank">  MMLU </a>  (5-shot) - a test to measure a text model's multitask accuracy. The test covers 57 tasks including elementary mathematics, US history, computer science, law, and more.
- <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07958" target="_blank">  TruthfulQA </a> (0-shot) - a test to measure a model‚Äôs propensity to reproduce falsehoods commonly found online.

We chose these benchmarks as they test a variety of reasoning and general knowledge across a wide variety of fields in 0-shot and few-shot settings.
"""

HUMAN_GPT_EVAL_TEXT = f"""
Evaluation is performed by having humans and GPT-4 compare completions from a set of popular open-source language models (LLMs) on a secret set of instruction prompts. The prompts cover tasks such as brainstorming, creative generation, commonsense reasoning, open question answering, summarization, and code generation. Comparisons are made by humans and a model on a 1-8 Likert scale, where the labeler is required to choose a preference each time. Using these preferences, we create bootstrapped Elo rankings.

We collaborated with **Scale AI** to generate the completions using a professional data labeling workforce on their platform, [following the labeling instructions found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c5-96Lj-UH4lzKjLvJ_MRQaVMjtoEXTYA4dvoAYVCHc/edit?usp=sharing). To understand the evaluation of popular models, we also had GPT-4 label the completions using this prompt.

For more information on the calibration and initiation of these measurements, please refer to the [announcement blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/llm-leaderboard). We would like to express our gratitude to **LMSYS** for providing a [useful notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lAQ9cKVErXI1rEYq7hTKNaCQ5Q8TzrI5?usp=sharing) for computing Elo estimates and plots.
