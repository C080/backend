## How it works

## Reproducibility
To reproduce our results, here is the commands you can run:

## Quantization
To get more information about quantization, see:
- 8 bits: [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/hf-bitsandbytes-integration), [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07339)
- 4 bits: [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/4bit-transformers-bitsandbytes), [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314)

## Model types
- {ModelType.PT.to_str(" : ")} model: new, base models, trained on a given corpora
- {ModelType.FT.to_str(" : ")} model: pretrained models finetuned on more data
Specific fine-tune subcategories (more adapted to chat):
- {ModelType.IFT.to_str(" : ")} model: instruction fine-tunes, which are model fine-tuned specifically on datasets of task instruction 
- {ModelType.RL.to_str(" : ")} model: reinforcement fine-tunes, which usually change the model loss a bit with an added policy. 
If there is no icon, we have not uploaded the information on the model yet, feel free to open an issue with the model information!

## Some good practices before submitting a model

### 1) Make sure you can load your model and tokenizer using AutoClasses:
```python
from transformers import AutoConfig, AutoModel, AutoTokenizer
config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained("your model name", revision=revision)
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("your model name", revision=revision)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("your model name", revision=revision)
```
If this step fails, follow the error messages to debug your model before submitting it. It's likely your model has been improperly uploaded.

Note: make sure your model is public!
Note: if your model needs `use_remote_code=True`, we do not support this option yet but we are working on adding it, stay posted!

### 2) Convert your model weights to [safetensors](https://huggingface.co/docs/safetensors/index)
It's a new format for storing weights which is safer and faster to load and use. It will also allow us to add the number of parameters of your model to the `Extended Viewer`!

### 3) Make sure your model has an open license!
This is a leaderboard for Open LLMs, and we'd love for as many people as possible to know they can use your model ðŸ¤—

### 4) Fill up your model card
When we add extra information about models to the leaderboard, it will be automatically taken from the model card

## In case of model failure
If your model is displayed in the `FAILED` category, its execution stopped.
Make sure you have followed the above steps first.
If everything is done, check you can launch the EleutherAIHarness on your model locally, using the above command without modifications (you can add `--limit` to limit the number of examples per task).
